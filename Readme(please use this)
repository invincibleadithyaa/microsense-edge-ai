# MicroSense-Edge-AI  

Microwatt Momentum 2025 Hackathon Project  
**Extending the Microwatt CPU with a Sensor Interface and Tiny AI Accelerator for Edge Applications**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Summary
Microwatt (open POWER CPU core) will be extended with:
1. **Sensor Interface** â€” allows Microwatt to read sensor data (simulated or via a simple bus).
2. **Tiny AI Accelerator** â€” a small MAC (multiply-accumulate) block that performs lightweight neural network operations.

This demonstrates **Microwatt for IoT + AI edge computing** â€” a CPU that can sense and think.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why This Matters
IoT devices often read sensors but struggle with AI workloads. By adding an accelerator, Microwatt becomes capable of real-time processing at the edge.  
This is a step toward **open, customizable CPUs for smart edge applications**.
